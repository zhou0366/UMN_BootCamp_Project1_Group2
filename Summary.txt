We decided to examine water quality vs. GDP and also water quality vs. population density in order to see if we could find any correlations between water quality and these factors. We set about doing this by first cleaning the data set and trying to understand limitations of the data.  

Whereas there are general assumptions that larger population density leads to greater pollution levels, or that higher GDP and therefore higher product consumption leads to greater pollution levels, and there are also inverse assumptions that lower GDP countries not having as much money to clean up or prevent pollution, our data did not bear out any conclusive evidence of cause or effect or even correlation in those areas when it comes to water impairment. . Our data was limited to only a few indicators of water impairment. There is the possibility that other factors such as pharmaceuticals in the water may be higher in higher GDP countries, we did not examine those factors, so we cannot talk about that. But, our findings are not considering enough types of indicators of water impairment to make any statements on correlation between population density and water impairment or GDP and water impairment.
